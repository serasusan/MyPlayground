## Christmas Countdown Timer
A basic Countdown made using HTML,CSS & JS. I've hosted it on Netlify

Things I learned:
- about Date function
- setInterval()
- Implemented function and if else loop
- innerText, document.getElementById
- To check the status of days count and to replace the div with "It's Christmas!💚" or with the Counter.
