### What's MyPlayground?ðŸ–¤
I've often found myself deleting small learning projects, like simple counters, after I've practiced with them. Instead of discarding them entirely, I had the idea to store them on GitHub. However, I didn't want my GitHub profile to be cluttered with numerous small projects that might overshadow the larger ones.

After some consideration, I devised a solution: creating a separate branch for each small project in this repo and hosting them on Netlify. Connecting GitHub directly to Netlify allowed me to host each branch individually.

In each branch, you'll find these small projects. I've included the hosted link and <b>documented the concepts I've learned</b> while working on each project.

### Projects build so far:
1. Christmas Countdown Timer
